- Hi, Iâ€™m @cheasy.
- Iâ€™m interested in all things FreeBSD, embedded computing, and Unix
- At this time I'm learning YAUT (yet another userful tool), which happens to be Ansible at the moment, but this may change a any moments notice.
- Currently, I'm interested in collaborating on all things for DB Netz AG.
- Leave a message @cheasy on Twitter, or mail me at ðŸ“«@cheasy.de - all addresses work, but you have to know the prefix to get priority answers.
- I am not available on WhatsApp. Try Signal, Wire, Threema, â€¦ instead.
- If all of the above does not work for you, ask Bing or Google for coordinates.
